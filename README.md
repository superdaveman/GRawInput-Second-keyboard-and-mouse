# GRawInput
GRawInput is a modification for games "Gothic" and "Gothic 2" that change old deprecated DirectX7 Direct Input Keyboard and Mouse interface over native Windows Events.
It offers a way to enhance your experience with alt-tabbing the game and to make it easier to use ingame overlays like Steam Overlay or ReShade Overlay.

# Second keyboard and mouse
Modified SaiyansKing's modification to allow for a second keyboard and mouse. The input of any other keyboard and mouse other than the first that are used within the game are redirected to the Direct Input joystick and all serve as the same second keyboard and mouse.
